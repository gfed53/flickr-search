# Flickr 'round the World

## About

Flickr 'round the World retrieves search results from Flickr's API using GET requests via AngularJS's $http service. Previously known as just plain old Flickr Searcher, this app was reformatted and redesigned to incorporate the Google Maps API. It allows the user to select a portion of the world and search for nature-based photos specifically taken from that area.

## The Process

Developing this app helped me learn more about API hacking using the AngularJS framework, as well as exploring the use of notifications throughout the search process which, utilizing scope, can be rendered and displayed within the view.

A very important thing I learned while developing this app is that developers have to keep track of any changes in the APIs they use. Unbeknownst to me, some of the property names in the Flickr API had been changed, completely breaking the functionality of my app. It was an easy fix, simply updating the changed names, but it just goes to show that developers always have to keep track of any updates within their dependencies.
