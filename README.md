The Flickr Searcher app retrieves search results from Flickr's API using GET requests via AngularJS's $http service.

Developing this app helped me to learn more about API hacking using the AngularJS framework, and also facilitated the use of notifications throughout the search process which, utilizing scope, can be rendered and displayed within the view.

I feel like there is more that I can add to this app, and probably will do so in the future. I'm still fairly new to Flickr, so there may be something I come across in the near future that will spark an idea. Most likely I will add a more advanced search engine if the API allows it.
