# Flickr 'round the World

Flickr 'round the World retrieves search results from Flickr's API using GET requests via AngularJS's $http service. Previously known as just plain old Flickr Searcher, this app was reformatted and redesigned to incorporate the Google Maps API. It allows the user to select a portion of the world and search for nature-based photos specifically taken from that area.

Developing this app helped me learn more about API hacking using the AngularJS framework, as well as exploring the use of notifications throughout the search process which, utilizing scope, can be rendered and displayed within the view.
